# Data Analysis and Preprocessing with Pandas

This project focuses on **data loading, cleaning, and analysis** using the **Pandas** library in Python.  
It demonstrates essential data processing techniques, including filtering, handling missing values, and summarizing dataset statistics.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts Covered
- Importing datasets from CSV files using `pandas.read_csv()`
- Applying filters to extract meaningful subsets of data
- Identifying and filling missing values using mean imputation
- Generating descriptive statistics with `data.describe()`

### ðŸ§  Objective
To develop a strong understanding of **data preprocessing workflows** and the practical use of Pandas for real-world data analysis.
